\paragraph{To accomplish this task, I first began by defining the functions I would need; these were the approximate derivative function, the approximate derivative function using the Taylor series, and the error of the approximation of the numerical derivations. I then realized that all that needed to be accomplished inside this function was to approximate the value of the derivative, therefore meaning I simply had to return the results of the approximated derivative equation. I then defined all the variables I would need for the problem such as x not, d\textunderscore analytical and the range of h values. Then I finally created a for loop to run each of the functions, and collected that data inside the for loop then used a the python package 'mathplotlib' to display the data in a graph.}

\paragraph{The plotted results of the error of the approximated derivative as a function of the h step size values, reveals as the value of h increases, the error in the approximated derivation increases proportionally after the value approximately at 0.15 step size. The graph also begins as almost horizontal for the h values ranging from approximately 0.0 to 0.2, signifying that that smaller values of h make the difference in error almost indistinguishable.  This trend would increases with smaller values of h but decrease with larger ones as seen when the value of h reaches 0.8 and yields a large error in the approximated derivative.}
